## Introduction
ҽʅʋα is a free manga and comic downloader written in C# with WPF that is currently under development. 🖥️

ҽʅʋα is a fast and beautiful WPF application that allows users to search various websites and download manga and comics. It uses the Shard.WebsiteScraper library to gather the necessary data from any included website. 📥💻

You can download ҽʅʋα here: [Download ҽʅʋα](https://typnull.github.io/Elva/Elva.application)
Websites to download from can be found here: [Supported Websites](https://github.com/TypNull/WebsiteScraper/tree/master/Websites) 

Please be mindful when using ҽʅʋα to download manga and comics. While the download itself is fast and convenient, it is important to consider the impact on the comic or manga providers' servers and hosting costs. It is easy to mass download manga or comics and tey will probably never be read so please be mindfull
We do not want to cause any harm or disruption to their systems.
