## Introduction
Elva is a manga and comic downloader written in C# with WPF that is currently under development. 🖥️

Elva is a fast and beautiful WPF application that allows users to search various websites and download manga and comics. It utilizes the Shard.WebsiteScraper library to gather the necessary data from websites and facilitate the download process. 📥💻

Please be mindful when using Elva to download manga and comics. While the download itself is fast and convenient, it is important to consider the impact on the comic or manga providers' servers and hosting costs. We do not want to cause any harm or disruption to their systems.

Please note that Elva is still in development and not yet ready for use. However, if you are interested in exploring it, you can download the source code and build it yourself. 🔧
