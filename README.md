## Introduction
ҽʅʋα is a free manga and comic downloader written in C# with WPF that is currently under development. 🖥️

ҽʅʋα is a fast and beautiful WPF application that allows users to search various websites and download manga and comics. It uses the Shard.WebsiteScraper library to gather the necessary data from any included website. 📥💻

You can download ҽʅʋα here: [Download ҽʅʋα](https://typnull.github.io/Elva/Elva.application)

Websites to download from can be found here: [Supported Websites](https://github.com/TypNull/WebsiteScraper/tree/master/Websites) 

When using ҽʅʋα to download manga and comics, please keep in mind the potential impact on the servers and hosting costs of the comic or manga providers. Although the download process is quick and convenient, it is crucial to consider the consequences. Mass downloading manga or comics that may never be read can be harmful and disruptive to their systems. Let's be responsible and avoid causing any harm or disruption.
